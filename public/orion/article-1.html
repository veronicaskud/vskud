                Do you welcome challenge, or avoid it?
            </h1>
            <p>
                This is an important question, according to Stanford psychologist Dr. Carol Dweck, because it gives you a clue to your mindset. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                Fixed Mindset
            </h2>
            <p>
                Dr. Dweck’s research found that people who believe they are born with an unchangeable amount of intelligence and ability -- in other words, people with a “fixed mindset” --  often avoid challenging tasks. Facing a challenge might show weakness or lead to mistakes, so they can’t take the risk. This fixed mindset leads to seeing mistakes or failure as a sign that they can’t do it and shouldn’t try.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Growth Mindset
            </h2>
             <p>
                    People in Dr. Dweck’s studies who believed they could increase intelligence with time and effort welcomed challenge and performed better. With their “growth mindset,” they perceived errors as learning opportunities and tough problems as a chance to get better at something. As someone who tends to persist, you may have more of a growth mindset, which can lead you to put in the effort it takes to improve your skills and get closer to your goals.

                Here’s the thing: Life is full of challenges, problems, and obstacles. How can you build a growth mindset that helps you face them and take action?
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn about the brain. Your brain has “plasticity,” which means that it can change and grow. </li>
                    <li>Be aware of your mindset. Listen to your inner self-talk. If you hear “I can’t” and “I’m not good at that” a lot, you may be dealing with a fixed mindset. Try to shift that talk to phrases like “This is hard but I can get better at it,” or “I can do this if I keep trying.”</li>
                    <li>See mistakes as normal and necessary. Not only does everyone make mistakes, but the strongest lessons come from looking carefully at what went wrong and adjusting the next time. Think about the things you’ve learned “the hard way” — you never forget them!</li>
                    <li>Recognize the power of YET. You can say “I can’t,” and retreat to something you already know how to do…or you can say “I can’t…YET!” and give it a try, doing your best and knowing that your time and effort will increase your ability to do better what you don’t yet know how to do. </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="article-q">
                <q>What did you learn today? What mistake did you make that taught you something? What did you try hard at today?</q>
