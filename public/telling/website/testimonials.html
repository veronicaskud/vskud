					<p>&#8220;Since the inception of the TELLING Player and Platform, I have been impressed by the way IN THE TELLING has been able to tell the story of EWB-USA. It is not just telling a story. <strong>It is about telling the story in a holistic way that makes use of all our senses</strong> and creates a Wow moment. Thank you IN THE TELLING for the Wow factor in telling our story.&#8221;</p>

					<p>&#8220;When we were initiating the Madrone Project (video based education on sustainability) we looked far and wide for an app to use as our foundation. TELLING is <strong>quite simply the best application on the market</strong>. And the team brings educational expertise, video capacity and integrity. They are the perfect partner for our work.&#8221;</p>

					<p>&#8220;The documentary feel to the short films, the animations&#8230;they engage students.  <strong>Students really feel like they learn more deeply</strong>, partly because they are shot very professionally, but also because the transcripts are synchronized with the film as it moves forward with the transmedia. It&#8217;s almost like my electronic scrapbook that I&#8217;m putting together for the students to tell a greater overall narrative.&#8221;</p>

One of the things that really helps in this course is the team that takes my words and translates those into graphics and pictures and animations that greatly augments the student&#8217;s ability to understand.&#8221;</p>

					&#8220;The spine of each course is organized around a sequence of high production value, brief videos. At a variety of points within each brief video segment, students can branch off to other resources and tracks, from narrated slideshows and animations that go deeper into a topic, to readings, to other videos, to practice problems, and other web sites.&#8221; <a href="http://go.gwu.edu/DigComm" target="_blank">&#8230;more</a>

					&#8220;I love the transmedia learning experience! It offers options to support various learning styles. I like how seamless the videos, slides, note-taking and supplemental materials are. <strong>The transmedia format opens up a larger, more diverse conversation into the classroom</strong> and students&#8217; private learning location. I love the exposure to different and varied resources that have been pulled together.&#8221;
