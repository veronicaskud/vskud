		<h3>Instruction, Produced</h3>
		<p>We&#8217;ve all experienced those priceless moments of insight: some moment of cognition provoked by a masterful storyteller. We&#8217;ve had these experiences live, but also in the experience of documentary film&mdash;a medium often under-appreciated for its instructional power. We bring the experience and technology to help educators harness this power, and distribute new digital narratives in a cinematic format optimized for playback on mobile devices.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col col-2 blurb">
		<img src="img/icons/media.png"> 
		<h3>The Art of Engagement</h3>
		<p>Too much of the instructional content provided to learners today fails to inspire. By remixing instructional delivery with formats made popular by a changing consumer technology landscape, we tilt the odds in favor of educators vying for attention. The result is highly produced and polished, more convenient for concept review, and more captivating as a performance. We believe these are meaningful contributions to improve student engagement.</p>
	</div>

<div class="row gridrow">
	
	<div class="col col-3 blurb">
		<img src="img/icons/link.png"> 
		<h3>Technology</h3>
		<p>We assume the presence of an education platform, likely an LMS product. Our finished works integrate seamlessly with any modern LMS compliant with open standards for learning tool interoperability. We supplement LMS platforms with film-industry grade cloud video distribution to ensure scaled playback by learners.</p>

		<h3>Easy Authoring Tools</h3>
		<p>TELLING Producer helps educators develop, assemble and publish mobile-device ready video narratives that raise the bar on engaging students in blended learning, flipped classroom, and distance education. Educators can build and evolve their documentary instruction productions.</p>

		<h3>Course Format</h3>
		<p>Our experience suggests a convergence of requirements across what were once darker lines separating &#8220;traditional&#8221; and &#8220;distance&#8221; courses. Some require receiving all instructional content online, and thus require recorded instruction. Others may flip a classroom using instructional video as part of that strategy. Our approach is agnostic about format.</p>

		<h3>Creative Services</h3>
		<p>IN THE TELLING producers and course designers work with instructors to plan and develop their documentary instruction productions, courseware and instructor offline bio shorts. We become partners in producing your instruction for mobile-media learners with as little burden or disruption to faculty as possible.</p>
